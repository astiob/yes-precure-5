Comment: 0,0:02:36.05,0:02:36.13,Default,,0,0,0,,OP = 02:36.073 (first frame of OP not a keyframe this time!!) - Doesn't mean i can't use the first frame, as i use the "shift selected subs so they start on this frame" to shift the OP and the timing is preserved, then alter from there. // basically yeah, you'll need to use another frame, like the "ookiku nattara" line I pointed out later. Which you've clearly done, since everything lines up.
